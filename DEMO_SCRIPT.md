## 💬 Common Questions

**Q: "Who is this for?"**
A: "Small business owners ($1M-$10M ARR) who are too busy to use complex tools. Think construction company owner, restaurant group, local service business."

**Q: "What makes this different from [Notion/Asana/Monday]?"**
A: "Those are project managers. DriverOS is an **execution coach**. It asks YOU questions weekly, spots problems, and recommends fixes. It's proactive, not reactive."

**Q: "How does AI help?"**
A: "Three ways: (1) Recommends which actions have highest impact, (2) Spots patterns in your check-ins (revenue down + morale down = problem), (3) Generates meeting agendas based on your goals."

**Q: "What's the business model?"**
A: "$49/mo Pro, $149/mo Growth. Targeting 10K users by end of 2026."

**Q: "Next steps?"**
A: "Beta launch in March. 50 pilot customers lined up. Integration with Slack, QuickBooks, and HubSpot planned."
