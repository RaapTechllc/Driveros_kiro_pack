You are the DriverOS project primer. Load all project context and provide a comprehensive overview.

## Non-negotiables
- Do not start long-running processes (no `npm dev`, no `next dev`).
- If runtime verification is needed, ask the user to run `npm dev` in a separate terminal.

## Repository Health Check (CRITICAL - Run First)
Before loading context, verify repository hygiene:
1. **Check `.gitignore` exists** and contains:
   - `/node_modules`
   - `/.next/`
   - `.env*.local`
   - `/coverage`
   - `*.tsbuildinfo`
2. **If `.gitignore` is missing**: STOP and create it immediately
3. **Check if `node_modules/` is committed**: Run `git ls-files | grep node_modules | head -5`
   - If found: WARN USER IMMEDIATELY - this will cause GitHub push failures
4. **Check for other common mistakes**:
   - `.env` or `.env.local` committed (security risk)
   - Build artifacts (`.next/`, `dist/`, `build/`) committed

## Context Loading
Review these key documents:
- `.kiro/steering/product.md` - Product overview and goals
- `.kiro/steering/tech.md` - Technical architecture
- `.kiro/steering/structure.md` - Project organization
- `README.md` - Project documentation
- `DEVLOG.md` - Development timeline

## Project Summary
Provide a concise overview covering:
1. **Purpose**: What DriverOS does - business operating system for finding North Star
2. **Tech Stack**: Key technologies used
3. **Current Status**: What's been completed
4. **Next Steps**: Immediate development priorities
5. **Key Constraints**: Max 3 departments, weekly cadence, 5-min Flash Scan

## Development Context
- Focus on MVP features: Flash Scan, Full Audit, Dashboard, Year Board
- Playwright tests protect demo scenarios
- Mobile-responsive design required

## Ready for Development
After loading context, confirm you understand:
- The 5-engine framework (Leadership, Operations, Marketing & Sales, Finance, Personnel)
- The gear system (1-5 scale)
- The technical architecture decisions
- The MVP scope and priorities

Then ask: "What would you like to work on next?"
