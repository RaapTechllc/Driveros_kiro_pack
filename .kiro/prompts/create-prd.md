Generate a Product Requirements Document for a new DriverOS feature.

## Context
DriverOS is a business operating system that helps companies:
- Find their North Star (strategic vision)

## Constraints
- Max 3 departments per company

3. **Acceptance Criteria**: EARS format (Event-Action-Response-State)
4. **Success Metrics**: How do we measure success?
5. **Out of Scope**: What are we NOT building?

## Output Location
- `docs/prd/[feature-name].md`

## Quality Gates
