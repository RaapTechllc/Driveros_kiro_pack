description: Keep README install + demo steps correct
---

Update `README.md` to match the current app.

Must include:
- What DriverOS is (2–4 bullets)
- Requirements (node version, env vars)
- Install steps (copy/paste)
- Run steps (copy/paste)
- Demo in 60 seconds (numbered)
- What is in scope (Flash Scan, Full Audit, Dashboard, CSV)
- What is out of scope (no integrations)

Keep it short.
Keep it accurate.
