description: Check steering docs against PRD and list mismatches
---

Read the PRD in `docs/` (or the main spec file if present).
Compare it to `.kiro/steering/product.md` and `.kiro/steering/scope.md`.

Output:
- mismatches (bullets)
- suggested steering edits (exact lines to add/change)
- any scope risks for hackathon
