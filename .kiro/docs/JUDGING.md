# Judging Notes — DriverOS

## 2-minute pitch
- Teams drown in metrics.
- DriverOS forces one North Star.
- It recommends one weekly Accelerator.
- It outputs 3–5 wins you can execute this week.
- It keeps departments aligned, not noisy.

## Demo flow (fast path)
1) Flash Scan (under 5 minutes)
2) Dashboard: Gear → Engines → Accelerator → Actions
3) Open Meetings template (Pit Stop)
4) Export Actions CSV

## What is “new”
- Not another dashboard.
- It’s an operating system for focus:
  - one goal
  - one weekly lever
  - a short list of actions

## How we used Kiro
- Steering docs lock scope and product rules.
- Prompts enforce a repeatable build loop.
- Agent-style workflow keeps outputs consistent.

## Common judge questions
**How do teams align?**  
Every goal must link to the North Star. No orphan goals.

**Why weekly?**  
Weekly is the right cadence for signal. Daily is noise for most teams.

**Why no integrations?**  
Hackathon scope. CSV is the bridge. Integrations can follow.

**What’s the moat?**  
Simple, enforced focus. Clear actions. Meeting templates tied to goals.

## Evidence checklist
- README install steps tested
- DEVLOG entries show progress
- Unit tests cover scoring + completion
- Playwright covers onboarding → dashboard
- Seed data exists for backup demo
