# Template Evolution

This project started with a lightweight hackathon-oriented `.kiro` setup.
We kept it in-repo to show how the orchestration system evolved alongside DriverOS.

## Why it stays

- It documents the path from early prompts to a reusable template.
- It helps judges see the progression, not just the end state.
- It keeps the hackathon constraints and decisions visible.

## What changed over time

- Early `.kiro` focused on speed and minimal prompts.
- The newer template adds orchestration workflows, richer docs, and a clearer agent catalog.
- The current folder keeps the original context while aligning with the modern template structure.

## Source of the current template

The active orchestrator template is documented here:

If we ever want to fully swap folders, we can replace `.kiro` with the template
and keep this file as a brief historical note in the main `docs/` folder.
