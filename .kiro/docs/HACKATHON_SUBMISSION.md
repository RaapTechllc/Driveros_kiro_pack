# Hackathon Submission — DriverOS

## One-liner
DriverOS turns a company’s **North Star** into a single weekly **Accelerator**, then outputs **3–5 data-driven wins** in minutes.

## Problem
Teams track too much. They ship too little.
Goals drift. Meetings create activity, not progress.

## Solution
Two-speed onboarding:
- **Flash Scan (free):** <5 minutes → instant Accelerator recommendation + 3–5 quick wins.
- **Full Audit (upgrade):** engine scores + rationale + actions + meeting templates + aligned department goals.

## What the judge will see
1) Run the app.
2) Complete Flash Scan (fast).
3) Land on Dashboard:
   - Gear (Idle → Apex)
   - Signal Board (5 Engines)
   - Accelerator (weekly)
   - Brakes (risks)
   - Action Bay (Do Now / Do Next)
4) Export Actions/Goals CSV.

## Key features
- **North Star Goal:** one per company.
- **Aligned goals:** up to **3 departments** (Ops, Sales/Marketing, Finance).
- **AI-first:** always recommends an Accelerator. “Other” exists for override.
- **One-sentence rationale:** every engine shows “why” in plain English.
- **Meetings:** Warm-Up, Pit Stop, Full Tune-Up.
- **CSV import/export:** Actions + Goals. No external integrations.
