# Onboarding

## Principles
- Short first.
- Value first.
- Upgrade later.

## Flow A: Flash Scan (free)
Step 1: Company basics
- industry
- size band
- role
- north star (one sentence)
- top constraint (cash|capacity|demand|delivery|people)

Step 2: Instant output
- recommended weekly Accelerator (with “Other” override)
- 3–5 quick wins with owners
- checklist to unlock Full Audit

## Flow B: Full Audit (upgrade)
Step 1: Team setup (simple)
- pick departments (max 3)
- pick a lead for each department (optional in MVP)
- confirm North Star

Step 2: Audit intake
- answer engine questions (grouped by engine)
- capture basic finance “brakes” fields
- capture freedom sliders if available

Step 3: Audit output
- gear + reason
- 5 engines + rationale + action
- Accelerator (weekly)
- brakes (flags + controls)
- goals: North Star + department goals aligned to it
- actions: do now / do next

## Multi-employee onboarding (MVP approach)
- One company creates North Star first (usually CEO/Owner).
- Other users can submit audit answers for their department later.
- If multiple submissions exist:
  - use the most recent per department
  - show “data freshness” in UI
