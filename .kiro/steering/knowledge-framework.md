# DriverOS Knowledge Framework

## Purpose
Transform DriverOS from a diagnostic tool into a business mastermind platform that delivers expert-level guidance, not just data.

## Three-Dimensional Knowledge System

### Dimension 1: Business Phase Framework
Five phases of business evolution:

| Phase | Description | Focus |
|-------|-------------|-------|
| **Genesis** | Startup/early stage | Survival, product-market fit |
| **Momentum** | Growing, gaining traction | Systems, repeatability |
| **Velocity** | Scaling rapidly | Team, delegation |
| **Mastery** | Optimized operations | Efficiency, margins |
| **Legacy** | Succession-ready | Exit, continuity |

### Dimension 2: Economic Discipline Framework
Core metrics that drive business health:

- **LTV:CAC Ratio**: Customer lifetime value vs acquisition cost
  - Target: 3:1 minimum, 8:1+ for services
- **The Brick**: One weekly KPI that moves outcomes
- **Cash Flow**: Survival metric - cash collected, not revenue
- **Value Equation**: Dream Outcome × Likelihood ÷ Time × Effort

### Dimension 3: Three Freedoms Model
Business owner progression:

| Freedom | Description | Indicator |
|---------|-------------|-----------|
| **Role Freedom** | Not doing every job | Can take 1 week off |
| **Perspective Freedom** | Working ON not IN | Strategic time > 20% |
| **Time Freedom** | Business runs without you | Can take 1 month off |

## Lead Generation: Core Four

Four channels for consistent lead flow:

1. **Warm Outreach**: Existing network, referrals, past customers
2. **Content**: Educational material that attracts ideal customers
3. **Cold Outreach**: Direct contact with prospects
4. **Paid Ads**: Paid traffic to offers

**Rule**: Master one before adding another.
