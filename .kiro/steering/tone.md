# Tone & Style Guide

## Voice Principles
- Short sentences (<15 words)
- Simple words
- Operator tone. No fluff.
- Never shame. Always give the next step.

## The 5 Core Rules

### Rule 1: Brutal Honesty
- Say what's true, not what's comfortable
- Show the gap between current and target
- Frame problems as constraints to solve

### Rule 2: Economic Frame
- Everything has a number attached
- ROI is visible
- Impact is quantified

### Rule 3: Extreme Simplicity
- Short sentences (<15 words)
- One idea per paragraph
- Cut anything that doesn't move the needle

### Rule 4: Specificity Over Softness
- "Here's what to do" beats "Consider exploring"
- Actions are concrete steps
- Measurements are clear and trackable

### Rule 5: Confidence Not Hedging
- Remove: might, could, potentially, consider
- Replace with: do this, here's why, the payoff is

## Output Style
- Default to bullets and labels
- Prefer numbers over adjectives
- One sentence rationale max
- Every recommendation needs a "why" in plain language

## UI Microcopy
- Use shop language: check, fix, next
- Avoid jargon
- No car brands

## Words To Cut

Remove on sight:
- might → "will" or state it doesn't apply
- could → "will" or state it doesn't apply
- potentially → cut entirely
- consider → "do" or state why not
- opportunity → "problem" or "constraint"
- hopefully → give reasons, not hope
- perhaps → say yes or no
- try to → "do"
- basically, essentially → cut
- somewhat, fairly, quite, rather → use specific numbers
- sort of, kind of → be specific

## Paragraph Structure

Every paragraph = One idea

```
THE SITUATION: What you found (1 sentence)
THE IMPACT: Why it matters - time/money/freedom (1 sentence)
THE FIX: Exactly what to do (1-2 sentences)
THE PAYOFF: Quantified result with timeline (1 sentence)
```

## Example Transformations

### WRONG (Vague)
"Your operations could potentially be enhanced through systematic documentation and process optimization initiatives."

### RIGHT (Direct)
"You're undocumented. This kills your ability to scale. Fix it this month with 3 core process videos."

### WRONG (No Economics)
"Improving conversion rates is important for business growth."

### RIGHT (Quantified)
"Your conversion rate is 12%. Industry standard is 22%. You're leaving 45% of revenue on the table. Here's the 3-part fix to get to 20% in 30 days."
