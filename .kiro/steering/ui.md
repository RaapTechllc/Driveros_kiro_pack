- Use theme tokens (no hard-coded colors where possible).
- Provide a visible theme toggle in the header.

## Visual language
- Clean shop board.
- Gauges + cards + checklists.

- No cars, no brands, no “vehicle skins”.

## Layout rules
- Dashboard is the hero.
- Put the Accelerator and North Star at the top.
- Signal Board (5 engines) is the second block.
- Action Bay is always visible without scrolling on laptop.

## Engine cards
Each card shows:
- status color (red/yellow/green)
- score (0–100) or "unknown"
- rationale (one sentence)
- next action (one sentence)

## Gauges
Keep gauges readable.
- Show number + label.
- Use a simple arc or bar.
- Always add plain text under the gauge.

## Empty states
If data is missing:

- do not show a blank chart

## Copy style
- short labels
- one sentence explanations
- “do this next” language

## Accessibility
- Do not rely on color alone.
- Add status text: Red / Yellow / Green.
