# Goals (North Star + alignment)

## Core rule
One company.
One North Star.
Everything points to it.

## North Star (required)
- One sentence.
- One metric if possible.
- One deadline if possible.

Example:
- "Hit $2M ARR by Dec 31 with 20% net margin."

## Departments (MVP cap = 3)
Default set:
1. Ops
2. Sales/Marketing
3. Finance

Each department goal must:
- be measurable
- have one owner role
- include alignment_statement (one sentence)

Alignment statement template:
- "This increases the odds of the North Star by ______."

Example:
- Dept: Ops
  Goal: "Cut cycle time from 21 days to 14 days by May 1."
  Alignment: "Faster delivery increases capacity and revenue without hiring."

## No orphan work
- Every action must attach to a goal.
- Every goal must attach to the North Star.
